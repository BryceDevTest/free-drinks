## üü° Method 1: McDonald's Free Refill Strategy

**Objective:** Gain access to soft drinks using a water cup, with potential for infinite refills.

### Steps:

1. Enter any McDonald's location casually.
2. Approach the front counter and ask for a *water cup*.
   - Politely request a **medium-sized** water cup if possible.
   - If denied, accept the **small transparent water cup**.
3. Proceed to the self-serve drink station.
   - Fill the cup halfway with **ice**.
   - Pour out a portion of the ice to make room for soda.
   - Fill the rest of the cup with your desired drink (e.g. Coca-Cola).
4. Exit the location while sipping normally.
5. Retain the cup and **return later** to refill as needed.
   - Staff rarely monitor water cup usage after the initial visit.
6. *(Optional Advanced Strategy)*: Locate a **used large McDonald's cup** (e.g. from public bins or left on tables).
   - Wash thoroughly and reuse for **maximum refill capacity**.

2. Acquire a cup:
   - **Purchase** a small or large ICEE cup.
   - Or locate an **abandoned cup** in good condition.
3. Finish the drink and **remove the straw** to make it look fresh.

5. Approach the truck **from the opposite side** of the payment line.
   - Speak confidently:  
     `"Hi, could I get a [flavor] refill? Thanks."`
